## Catfriends

I made this app as part of a Udemy course, demonstrating how React can be used to quickly build and render separate components.

The initial app used randomly generated robots, which I changed to cats.

This was my first app made using React and whilst the code was developed as part of a course, it gave me a good understanding of how the code and React itself works.

Tachyons is used to provide some of the styling to keep the focus on React rather than CSS.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
